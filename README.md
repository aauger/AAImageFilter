# FilterDotNet
.NET 6.0 rendition of an old image filter project I had started. Porting work continues.

Filters are built in a separate class library, and intended to be used with configurators when necessary.

TODO: Update README.md to reflect the changes

Included is a UI that flexes each of the currently included filters & generators
